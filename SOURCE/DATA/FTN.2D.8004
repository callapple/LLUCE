Format Of Files Used To Store Messages By LLUCE.
______________________________________________________________________________

This file is used to store text used for messages and mail.
There are four parts to the file.

The first part is a header, containing information about the file itself as
well as a copy of the data for the highest used message number.
The header is always 32 bytes long.

The second part is a bitmap containing bits that refer to individual blocks
within the actual text storage area of the file.

The third part is the directory containing information relating to each message
in the file as well as the first block used by the message.

The fourth part is used for actual text storage.

HEADER FORMAT
-------------

$00  BITSIZE    Byte          Size of bitmap in blocks

$01  DIRSIZE    Byte          Size of directory in blocks

$02  USEDBLKS   Word          Number of blocks in use

$04  NUMFILES   Word          Actual number of messages in file

$06             Word          Reserved

$08  HIMSGNUM   Long word     First number of last message in file
$0C             Long word     Second number of last message in file
$10             Long word     Third number of last message in file
$14             Long word     Fourth number of last message in file

$18             8 Bytes       Reserved

4 byte numbers are stored low byte first.  High order bit of the third byte is
used as a negative flag.

BITMAP FORMAT
-------------

Each bitmap block is 128 bytes long.  Each byte contains 8 bits corresponding
to available blocks in the text storage area of the file.  The bit pattern is
from least significant bit to most significant bit.  Eg: Bit 0 of byte 0
corresponds to block 0.

There are 16 bytes for each message allowed in the file.  this allows for
messages up to a total of 8K each.  If some messages are shorter, then others
can be longer.

DIRECTORY FORMAT
----------------

$00  BLKPTR     Word          Pointer to first block used by this message
                              If zero, this message has been deleted.

$02  MSGx       3 Bytes       First number of message
                3 Bytes       Second number of message
                3 Bytes       Third number of message
                3 Bytes       Fourth number of message

$0E             Word          Reserved

Message numbers are referred to by the command MSG(X) or MSG(X,Y).

MSG(X) is equivalent to MSG(X,0).  Y is in the range 0..3.

TEXT AREA FORMAT
----------------

$00  TEXT       126 Bytes     This is standard text, no formatting is done.
$7D

$7E  NXTBLK     Word          Pointer to next block of message.
                              If zero, there are no more blocks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The header starts at byte 0 of the file.
The bitmap starts at byte 32.
To calculate the start of the directory, use the following formula:

Dir Start = 32 + (BITSIZE * 128)

To calculate the start of the text area, use the following formula:

Text Start = 32 + (BITSIZE * 128) + (DIRSIZE * 128)
